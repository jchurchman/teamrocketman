## WELCOME PG
“Welcome to (makeyourownwebsitegame) (userName)! I'm your Narrator. We’re going to build a webpage together. Sounds fun, right?! Don’t worry, I’ll help you through it. If you ever get stuck, you can always refer back to me. We just need to collect a few pieces of content from you. Fill out the form above and hit the submit button to get started! "

    *(user fills out form and clicks submit button to start the game)*


## LAYOUT PG

“Great! Look how cute that (marsupial) is. We’ve added the content, so, let’s look at the layout. We'll go through the whole process and if you don't like the formatting, you can hit the reset button to start over. 

Now, we’re going to add borders to all of our HTML elements. This will help you better understand what is known as the Box Model. ” 

    *(user clicks button to add borders)*

“Basically every element on your webpage is in a box. We’ve added these borders to show you how your elements interact with one another (don’t worry, we’ll get rid of them after we’re done formatting the page). We want our web pages to look appealing by giving them some white space. So, let’s add some margins.

    *(user clicks button to add margins)*

“Doesn’t that look better? We’ve centered the content on our page, utilizing white space. 
We want our header to really stand out. Let's make it a little bigger by increasing the pixel size. Right now our font is set to 16px. Try typing in 32 for the pixel value of the header."

    *(user inputs ' 32 ' clicks button to change font size of the header to 32)*

“ Great, our header is set. 
When you have images with text that relates to it, you want to see that visually. The float property will allow us to do this by putting the text next to the image. Click the float button and see what happens!	"
    
    *(user clicks button to set float on the img - putting the image on the left and the text on the right)*

" Now that our content is formatted, let's choose the font. Currently, the paragraph font is ______ and we want to make it ______. "
    
    *(user clicks button to set font to a sans-serif font: Arial, Helvetica, blah.)*

“ We're almost there! The last step is to create a navigation bar from the list that you created on the last page. First, we need to get rid of the bullet points, which is a list style. In the field below, type 'none' to remove the bullet points. "

    *(user types 'none' to take off bullet points (list-style-type:none;))*

"Lastly, we want a horizontal navigation bar. Type 'inline' to change the display of these list items." 
    *(user types 'inline' to look like a nav bar -make display:inline?)*

"Great job! We've formatted our page. Let's add some color to make it pop."
    *(user clicks submit button to move onto color page)*



## COLOR PG
*(create radio buttons for color options for each element)*

“ Welcome to a world of color! Black and white can be very appealing, but color can also add a lot to a page. Let's experiment! 
First, choose a color for the background of your page. "

    *(clicks radio button to select backgroundcolor of the body- options: grey, lightblue)*

“Next, choose a color for your header.		"

    *(clicks radio button to select font color of h1 - options: darkgreen, maroon)*

“Lastly, choose a color for the text in your paragraph.	"

    *(clicks radio button to select font color of p - options: darkblue, red)*

"What do you think? If you're happy with it, submit it to see your changes, so far."
    *(user clicks submit to move onto rough draft, or reset button to start over)*



## ROUGH DRAFT PG
"This is pretty much what your page looks like after incorporating the choices that you've made. Uh oh! We want to show you the final page, but we've lost the link to the final submit button! In order to find the button, we need your help selecting an element from the drop-down menu. "

    *give user list of elements (drop down) and select an element, then click hide it button - element will disappear from pg and drop down menu*
    *user chooses h1 - h1 disappears*
    *user chooses p - p disappears*
    *user chooses img - img disappears (AND VOILA THEY FOUND THE BUTTON)*



## FINAL PG

    *(user sees animation of start to finish of their page )*
