WELCOME PG
“Welcome to (makeyourownwebsitegame) (userName)! I'm your Narrator. We’re going to build a webpage. Sounds fun right?! Don’t worry, I’ll help you through it. If you ever get stuck, you can always refer back to me. We just need to collect a few pieces of content from you. Fill out the form above and hit the submit button to get started! "

    *(clicks submit button to start the game)*


#LAYOUT PG
“Great! Look how cute that (marsupial) is. We’ve added the content, so, let’s look at the layout. We'll go through the whole process and if you dont like the formatting, (you can hit the reset button to start over). 

Now, we’re going to add some borders to all of our HTML elements. This will help you better understand what is known as the Box Model. ” 

    *(clicks button to add borders)*

“Basically every element in your webpage is in a box. We’ve added these borders to show you how your elements interact with one another on the page. (Don’t worry, we’ll get rid of them after we’re done formatting the page.) We want our web pages to look appealing by giving them some white space. So, let’s add some margins.

    *(clicks button to add margins)*

“Doesn’t that look better? We’ve centered the content on our page, utilizing white space. We want our header to really stand out. Let's make it a little bigger by increasing the pixel size. Try typing in 32 for the pixel value of the header. (Right now it's set at 16px, let's change it to 32px.) "

    *(input ' 32 ' clicks button to change font size of the header to 32)*

“ Great, our header is set. 
When you have images with text that relates to it, you want to see that visually. The float property will allow us to do this by putting the text next to the image. Click the float button and see what happens!	"
    
    *(clicks button to set float on the img - putting the image on the left and the text on the right)*

" Now that our content is formatted, let's choose the font. Currently, the paragraph font is ______, and we want to make it ______. "
    
    *(clicks button to set font to a sans-serif font: Arial, Helvetica, blah.)*

“ We're almost there! The last step is to create a navigation bar from the list you created on the last page. First, we need to get rid of the bullet points. In the field below, type 'none' to remove the bullet points. "

    *(typed 'none' to take off bullet points)*

"Lastly, we want a horizontal navigation bar. Type 'inline' to change the display of these list items." 
    *(typed 'inline' to look like a nav bar -make display:inline?)*
