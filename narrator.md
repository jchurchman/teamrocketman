## ABOUT US

## WELCOME PG
“Welcome to (makeyourownwebsitegame)! I'm your Narrator. We’re going to build a webpage together. Sounds fun, right?! Don’t worry, I’ll help you through it. If you ever get stuck, you can always refer back to me. We just need to collect a few pieces of content from you. Fill out the form above and hit the submit button to get started! "

    *(user fills out form and clicks submit button to start the game)*


## LAYOUT PG

“Great! Look how cute that (marsupial) is. We’ve added the content, so, let’s look at the layout. We'll go through the whole process and if you don't like the formatting, you can hit the reset button to start over. 

Now, we’re going to add borders to all of our HTML elements. This will help you better understand what is known as the Box Model. ” 

    *(user clicks button to add borders)*

“Basically every element on your webpage is in a box. We’ve added these borders to show you how your elements interact with one another (don’t worry, we’ll get rid of them after we’re done formatting the page). We want our web pages to look appealing by giving them some white space. So, let’s add some margins, make your choice below."

    *(user clicks button to add small or large margins to the body)*

“Doesn’t that look better? We’ve centered the content on our page, utilizing white space. 
We want our header to really stand out. Let's make it a little bigger by increasing the pixel size. Right now our font is set to 24px. Try typing in 32 for the pixel value of the header."

    *(user types ' ' into text field clicks button to change font size of the header to 32 or whatever they choose)*

“ Great, our header is set. 
When you have images with text that relates to it, you want to access that visually. The float property will allow us to do this by putting the text next to the image. Click on one of the buttons and see what happens!"
    
    *(user clicks left or right button to set float on the img - floating it left or right depending on their choice)*

" Now that our content is formatted, let's choose the font. Currently, the paragraph font is (Times) and we want to make it sans-serif to match the rest of our page. Select a font from the menu below."
    
    *(user selects from a drop down menu of fonts: Arial, Helvetica, Raleway. - need to hardcode Times into skeleton.css)*

“ We're almost there! The last step is to create a navigation bar from the list that you created on the last page. First, we need to get rid of the bullet points, which is a list style. In the field below, type 'none' to remove the bullet points. " 
(Stretch goal to talk about other style types that lists can be, these dots can be other things, blah blah, if user answer does not match, then kick back different style types for ULs)

    *(user types 'none' to take off bullet points (list-style-type:none;))*

"Lastly, we want a horizontal navigation bar. Right now the list is stacked, which is a block dislay. Let's change the display to inline." 
    *(user clicks button to change the nav bar -make display:inline)*

"Great job! We've formatted our page. Let's add some color to make it pop."
    *(user clicks submit button to move onto color page)*

    *(Stretch Goal OR user clicks reset button to start over)*



## COLOR PG
*(create radio buttons for color options for each element, only showing one block of color selection at a time.)*

“ Welcome to a world of color! Black and white can be very appealing, but color can also add a lot to a page. Let's experiment! 
First, choose a color for the background of your page. "

    *(clicks radio button to select backgroundcolor of the body - options: grey, lightblue)*

“Next, choose a color for your header.		"

    *(clicks radio button to select font color of h1 - options: darkgreen, maroon)*

“Lastly, choose a color for the text in your paragraph.	"

    *(clicks radio button to select font color of p - options: darkblue, red)*

"What do you think? If you're happy with it, submit it to see your changes, so far."
    *(user clicks submit to move onto rough draft, or reset button to start over, need to remove all borders before moving onto rough draft)*

    *(Stretch Goal OR user clicks reset button to start over)*


## ROUGH DRAFT PG
"This is pretty much what your page looks like after incorporating the choices that you've made. Uh oh! We want to show you the final page, but we've lost the link to the final submit button! In order to find the button, we need your help selecting an element from the drop-down menu. "

    *give user list of elements (drop down) and select an element, then click hide it button - element will disappear from pg and drop down menu*
    *user chooses h1 - h1 disappears*
    *user chooses p - p disappears*
