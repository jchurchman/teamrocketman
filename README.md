Code 201 Group Project

### Team Members:

##### Joe Churchman
##### Meryl Turner
##### Kate Rountree
##### Andrew Potter

### Pitch

Project Description: TeamRocketMan is creating an art/puzzle game supporting a narrative framework that instructs the user on general practice of building and coding a website.

### Key Points

Users will land on the About page.
Users will enter the narrative from the About page.
Users will move to a greeting page where they will be asked to input a few items of data which will be stored for later use in the narrative.
Users will move through the site pages using a mixture of input fueled DOM manipulation as well as puzzle-solving.
The development goal is to capture input from the user's journey, save it, and use it in development of the final page.
The final page will be determined by the choices that the user makes along the narrative.

### Specific Page Ideas

#### About
Photos and short bios of each member of the team.
*Blank space in page for a 5th team member (the user)*
*About the project blurb*

#### Page 1 - Welcome Page
Introduce Narrator -- Guide box
Input fields from simple form structure:
    - Name (text input)
    - Favorite Marsupial (dropdown)
    - How did you hear about us? (check boxes)
    - Select layout for wireframe (radio button)

#### Page 2 - Color page
Show gathered data and some hardcoded content in bare HTML layout
Narrator box pops in "This looks OK, how about adding some color?"
User is shown two drop down selector boxes.
    - Background
    - Header
    - Text color
One will contain HTML tags, one will have color options.
Changes will be made using an "Apply Changes" button.
User can move on by hitting a different button.
